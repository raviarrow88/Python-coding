151. Reverse Words in a String

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

 

Example 1:

Input: "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
Example 2:

Input: "  hello world!  "
Output: "world! hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
Example 3:

Input: "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

        l =len(s)
        
        if l<1:
            return s
        
        rev_str=''
        
        re = len(s)-1   #right end
        
        while re >=0:
            
            while re >= 0 and ' ' == s[re]:
                re-=1
            right = re
            
            while re >=0 and ' ' != s[re]:
                re-=1
            left = re+1
            
            word = s[left:right+1] if right >=0 else ""
            
            rev_str = rev_str + word + ' '
            
        return rev_str.rstrip()
